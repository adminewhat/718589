2022年最新www填空题-三w点com中间填什么　　再看这是一对野鸳鸯。男子来自另一个城市，今天从这里路过，他犹豫了许久，才给她打了一个电话。刚好男主人出差了，他就来到她的家，孩子住校，又给他俩提供了一个独处的空间。他们相思了十多年了，今天第一次幽会。两人都很激动，轻轻相拥着，泪水就流下来了。梦中多少次，眼前才是真啊。他还是那样，生动，温情。她已老去了不少，但他还依然爱着她，那是一种互相欣赏。男人和女人互相欣赏起来，可是不得了的事。他们在那个特殊的年令、那个特定的环境，结下了特殊的爱，所以永久，牢固。可惜，“恨不相逢未嫁时”，认识时彼此都有了家庭。他们互相思念，却难以见面。她去找他，坐车不方便；他有车，倒是方便，但目标又太大。就这样趁趁拖拖，一晃18年。那时电话都很少，现在手机都普遍了，还有电脑聊天，但他们却从不通话。不来往又忘不掉，结果很难受。女人想，她是绝不会随便跟一个男人上床的，她要经过漫长的“三阶段”才能到达上床的地步，那就是动心、动情，然后才能动性。但她愿意跟他上床，说明她对他不但动心、动情，并且早已达到动性的地步。她想如果能象《廊桥遗梦》里面的男女主人公那样，两个人能在一起生活几天也好啊，这一辈子也不愧了，可是不能啊。女人靠在男人宽阔的怀里，不说话只管流泪，她的心跳得厉害，她感到胸腔里一股热烘烘的东西不断地上涌，她感到自己就要熔化了；男人也不说话，他轻轻地抚摸着女人的头发，用嘴唇吻去女人流出的泪，而他自己的泪也忍不住流出来，两个人就这样拥着，把时间浪费过去了。他们原本计划是要痛快淋漓地做一场爱的，然而情到深处做不成爱，相逢就这样耽误了。
　　男子也挺难：帅点吧，太热门；不帅吧，拿不动手；绚烂点吧，说你太油；不作声吧，说你太闷；穿西服吧，说你太平静；穿随意一点吧，说你乡吧佬；会挣钱吧，怕你包二奶；不挣钱吧，又怕儿童断奶；匹配吧，怕本人懊悔；不匹配吧，怕她懊悔；要个儿童吧，怕出来没钱养；不要儿童吧，怕老了没人养。男子更难。

At ordinary times, what we call literary accomplishment, is mainly refers to poetry accomplishment;
And poetry culture, is mainly refers to the profound cultural background, you of your knowledge.
I don't think, have the certain literature tutelage, cannot write good poetry, even piece together a few of the so-called "good", it is only to amuse the children or have no culture street, even if you keep writing, still on the hall of the elegance, is still nothing.
I firmly believe that only good at absorbing excellent culture, strive to improve personal culture, human accomplishment, even if they don't write poetry, but from their mouth out things are generally not poetic, and talk to a cultured person is like in reading, draw in the other's nutrition;
If and an accomplishment, small-minded people together and talk with each other, it is equal to chronic suicide, because you are wasting your time.
